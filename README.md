# Hospital-Management-System-OOP
This is my Object oriented programming project which executes following features like viewing doctors, rooms, medicines as well as options like booking appointment, purchasing medicine and renting rooms. I have used fstream, sstream, string and vector libraries for efficient file handling, string parsing and data handling.
