# Hospital-Management-System-OOP

I recently completed a comprehensive hospital management system for my coursework, integrating advanced features like:

ðŸ”¹ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Implemented robust class structures for patients, doctors, rooms, medicines ensuring efficient data management and system scalability.

ðŸ”¹ File Handling: Utilized file handling to store and retrieve patient records securely, enhancing data persistence and management.

ðŸ”¹ Database Integration: Incorporated database functionalities for seamless data storage and retrieval, improving overall system performance and reliability.

ðŸ”¹ User Interface Design: Designed an intuitive UI for easy navigation and efficient user interaction, enhancing user experience and accessibility.

Areas for Further Improvement:

> Security Enhancements: Strengthening data security protocols to ensure compliance with healthcare privacy regulations and protect sensitive patient information.

> Performance Optimization: Optimizing system performance to handle larger datasets and improve response times, enhancing overall operational efficiency.

> Integration of AI: Exploring AI-driven solutions to automate routine tasks such as appointment scheduling and resource allocation, improving system intelligence and user satisfaction.

This project has deepened my understanding of healthcare management systems and software development, and I look forward to advancing these skills further in future projects.

The csv files have info in the following order;
